This repository contains code for **Digital Scale**, a system for robust on-device estimation of body‐mass index (BMI) directly from smartphone camera images. We train on a large-scale, real-world dataset collected in collaboration with WayBetter and Centre for Digital Health Interventions.

## Abstract
>Estimating BMI from camera images enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are impractical, such as in telehealth or emergencies. Existing approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this study, we present a deep learning‑based BMI estimation method trained on our **WayBED dataset**—a large, proprietary collection of **84,963 smartphone images** from **25,353 individuals**. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing low‑quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views. This process retained **71,322 high‑quality images** suitable for training. We achieve a **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9%** on our hold‑out test set (WayBED data) using full‑body images, the lowest value in the published literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve an **MAPE of 13%** on the completely unseen (during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable with state‑of‑the‑art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust generalization. We deploy the full pipeline—including image filtering and BMI estimation—on Android devices using the **CLAID framework**. We release our complete code for model training, filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open‑source contributions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

For a quick start with BMI prediction, check out the **[`get_started/`](get_started/)** folder. This streamlined setup allows you to run BMI inference in minutes:

### Quick Setup
1. **Navigate to get_started folder**:
   ```bash
   cd get_started
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download model weights and sample data**:
   - Contact: **rmanichand@ethz.ch** or **planger@ethz.ch**
   - Request: "Digital Scale model weights and sample data"

4. **Run BMI prediction**:
   ```bash
   python predict_bmi.py
   ```

### What's Included
- **Simplified model definitions** (SEDenseNet121/201)
- **Dataset handling utilities** for the Visual Body to BMI dataset
- **Inference script** with command-line options
- **Complete setup instructions** and troubleshooting guide

### Expected Performance
- **MAPE ~7.9%** on WayBED dataset using SEDenseNet121
- **Real-time inference** on modern GPUs
- **CPU compatibility** for environments without GPU access

**Note**: The `get_started/` folder excludes model weights and sample data to keep the repository lightweight. These files can be downloaded as a zip package from the authors.
